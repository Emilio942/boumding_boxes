# Bounding Box Annotation Tool

This project is in the development stage of creating an image editing software focused on adding bounding boxes to images. It's designed to assist in object detection and annotation tasks, crucial for machine learning and data analysis applications. However, the tool is currently a work in progress, with functionalities being actively developed and refined.

## Concept Overview

The Bounding Box Annotation Tool is being developed to provide a user-friendly interface for marking objects within images using bounding boxes. The software aims to simplify the process of annotating images for training machine learning models or for other purposes where precise object identification is required. Currently, the tool allows users to draw incomplete bounding boxes around objects, indicating that the software is still under active development.

## Current Features

- Incomplete bounding box drawing: Users can start to draw bounding boxes, which are saved as dashed or partially drawn to highlight the ongoing development.
- Image loading: The tool supports loading images onto which annotations can be made.

## Getting Started

The project is still in its early stages, and more comprehensive installation and usage instructions will be provided as development progresses.
